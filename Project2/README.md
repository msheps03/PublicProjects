## Project 2, ECE 241, Advanced Programming (Python), Fall 2020

Creating a graph that finds the shortest path between facebook users based upon friendship

Each person is given a friendship score based upon how connected they are to another user and this value is then used to create a maximum spanning tree, from a previously created minimum spanning tree

The user is then able to input any two persons from the list and the program will map a path, the shortest path, and/or tell you the distance between them.

QuexeX.py and Graph.py contain helper functions for the project2.py file, some of these helper functions were provided from the textbook, all helper functions that are utilized are well understood. "facebook_network(1).csv" contains the data used for the project.
