## Final project for ECE 122, Spring 2020

This project utilizes tkinter and basic principles of physics to create a class pong game and map the path of a ball given a specific launch trajectory and speed.

game1.py, game2.py, and cannon_ball accomplish different tasks. Game1 is a pong game with the computer, game2 is a player vs player pong game, and cannon_ball maps the path of a ball given a specific launch trajectory and speed.
